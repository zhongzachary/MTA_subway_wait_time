# MTA Subway Average Wait Time


## Why?
As a frequent subway rider, I often wondered why do I need to wait so long for a very pack train, but then another train will arrive 2 minutes after. Uneven trains create inefficiency in the system, which can easily illustrated by the following example:

Say there is 4 trains per hours. If you are unfortunate and you just missed a train when you arrived at the station, you will need to wait 15 minutes for the next train. But in average, one waits 7.5 minutes for their next trains.

But what if the trains aren't evenly spreaded out. "Train dispatcher is investigating a emergency brake engaged unexpectedly," said by the train operator. Now there is a big delay on one train and there is another train following right after. With that, the average wait time jumps to 8.4 minutes (an 17% increase).
